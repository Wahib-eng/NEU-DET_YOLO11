# NEU-DET_YOLO11
In this project , I trained the NEU-DET dataset using yolo11 algorithm.
I downloaded the dataset from an article which it has even annotations of the photos.
After training the this dataset it gives a nice result to detect different types of detects on metal surfaces.  

The data set has 6 classes, here are some examples for the results:

you can even choose a specific calss and add a new roboflow project. and add the prefered class to your dataset for better performance.
