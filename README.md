# NEU-DET_YOLO11
In this project, I trained the NEU-DET dataset using the YOLO11m algorithm.
The dataset was downloaded from the Northeastern University website, which includes annotated images, saving significant time during preprocessing.

After training the dataset, the results demonstrate the ability to accurately detect different types of defects on surfaces.

The dataset contains 6 classes. Below are some examples of the results:

You can even select specific classes to enhance performance by creating a new project in Roboflow. Simply add your preferred classes to the dataset for fine-tuning and improved accuracy.
